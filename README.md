:christmas_tree: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) solutions in JavaScript.

### 2019 and later
Each solution is a module export in `js/dayX.js` which returns an array of part1 and part2 answers.

It includes a runner: `node 2020 1` to just get the answer. `node 2020 1 bench` to benchmark the solution.

### 2018 and earlier
Daily solutions are added to `window.AdventOfCode` namespace, and are available under methods like `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.  
Each method returns an array of two elements: solution to part one and two.
